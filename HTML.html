                “Most of all I love the quiet places, a sleeping house just before everyone wakes, a car ride with the radio off, an unexpected lull in conversation. It’s not that I’m in love with silence, it’s that most things that are worth paying attention to can only be heard when it’s quite enough. The bird calls can predict thunderstorms. The way a person breathes can tell truths their words can’t. The most honest I love you I ever heard wasn’t in words but in a glance. Noise will tell you a story. Noise will fill up a room. But a moment of quiet; that will tell you the truth.”

                By the end of the week, the <strong class="highlight">noise</strong> gets loud: the Teams pings, the inbox drama, the spreadsheets screaming for formulas that stopped making sense by Wednesday. But tucked inside all that chaos is a strange kind of mercy; the <strong class="highlight">quiet</strong> that waits on the other side.
            </p>
            <p>
                This weekend, listen for it. The car ride with no radio. The pause before the house wakes. The breath that doesn’t have to be measured in 15-minute increments. That’s not nothing; that’s the world catching its breath and letting you catch yours too.
            </p>
            <p>
                We earned this silence; every ping, every spreadsheet meltdown, every caffeine-fueled miracle that somehow made it to Friday bought us this peace.
            </p>
