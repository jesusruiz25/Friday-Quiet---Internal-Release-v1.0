          <p>
            Most of all I love the quiet places, a sleeping house just before everyone wakes,<br/>
            a car ride with the radio off, an unexpected lull in conversation.<br/>
            It’s not that I’m in love with silence, it’s that most things that are worth paying attention to<br/>
            can only be heard when it’s quite enough.<br/>
            The bird calls can predict thunderstorms.<br/>
            The way a person breathes can tell truths their words can’t.<br/>
            The most honest I love you I ever heard wasn’t in words but in a glance.<br/>
            Noise will tell you a story. Noise will fill up a room.<br/>
            But a moment of quiet; that will tell you the truth.

          <p>By the end of the week, <strong>the noise</strong> gets loud: the Teams pings, the inbox drama, the spreadsheets screaming for formulas that stopped making sense by Wednesday. But tucked inside all that chaos is a strange kind of mercy; the <strong>quiet</strong> that waits on the other side.</p>

          <p>This weekend, listen for it. The car ride with no radio. The pause before the house wakes. The breath that doesn’t have to be measured in 15-minute increments. That’s not nothing; that’s the world catching its breath and letting you catch yours too.</p>

          <p>We earned this silence. Every ping, every spreadsheet meltdown, every caffeine-fueled miracle that somehow made it to Friday bought us this peace.</p>

          <p class="anchor"><strong>May your Teams notifications fall silent long enough for the world to hear your own breath</strong></p>
